# Veber
An experimental digital, fully-encrypted, secure monetary system built in Rust.

### How it works

Veber creates a web server, which can then be interacted with by using different URL parameters when accessing the server. The whole user experience/interaction is based off of URL parameters, although a UI could easily be made to make this interaction easier and more accessible, which I had started working on. All the data stored and transmitted is encrypted using multiple encryption methods.
